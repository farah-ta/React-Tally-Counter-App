# React-Tally-Counter-App
React Tally Counter App is created by using the **React Hooks useState()** to perform the required function. I have also used the **Material UI** for the User Interface part to beautify it.
## Material UI
install the Material UI by using the following command in your terminal. 
npm install @mui/material @emotion/react @emotion/styled
